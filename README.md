AutoPause
=========

A simple Tweak that pauses your Music when you decrease volume to zero,  
Music is automatically resumed when you increase volume again. 
Only increases/decreases using volume buttons (iDevice or Headphones) are observed
to prevent accidentally pausing Music when trying to adjust the volume using a volume slider. 

Tested on an iPhone 5 on iOS 7, 
older Versions of iOS are not supported.
